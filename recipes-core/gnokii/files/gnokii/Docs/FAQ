-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is gnokii?

A. It is the name of a project that aims to develop tools and drivers for
   the mobile phones and modems. These tools include modem drivers, console
   tools, GUI applications etc. All software that forms part of the project
   is released under the GNU General Public License.  Please see the COPYING
   file for more details on license/copying issues, the lack of warranty
   and where to send a postcard if you like gnokii :-)  Gnokii is designed
   to work on a variety of operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS X,
   Windows, etc.) and hardware platforms (PPC, Intel, etc.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How do you pronounce gnokii?

A. You can pronounce gnokii as "gnooki" or "gnocki" as you prefer :-)  Note,
   that there's already a gnocky project, a gtk2 frontend to gnokii, so keep
   it in mind to be able to distinct them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What models are supported?

A. You can assume that your phone is supported, however there are rare cases
   that you will get very limited functionality with gnokii. If you have a
   fairly modern phone you should use the following model setting in your
   config file:
    - model = series40, if you have Nokia non-Symbian Series60 phone,
    - model = gnapplet, if you have Nokia Symbian Series60 prior to 3rd
    Edition phone,
    - model = AT, for all other.
   If you have some older Nokia (like 6210) phone you may try using its
   brand name, eg. model = 6210.
   See also our <http://wiki.gnokii.org/index.php/Config> for configurations
   known to work.

   Symbian series60 3rd edition (most Nokia n and e series) are not
   supported by gnapplet driver due to changes in Symbian API. For now you
   can get some functionality using AT driver.
   
   gnokii will not work with iPhones, Windows Mobile phones, BlackBerries
   and most likely Androids. You can try using AT driver for that purpose
   but expected results are miserable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I get "Hmmm... GSM_LinkOK never went true. Quitting." message when
   running gnokii. What's wrong?

A. Gnokii cannot connect to the phone. Possible reasons are:
    - wrong serial port is defined in gnokii config file,
    - you are using the wrong cable,
    - you are using not supported phone model,
    - you don't have permission to write to /dev/ttySX device.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Does mgnokiidev need to be suid root?

A. Yes. gnokiid needs to create a symbolic link in the /dev directory.
   mgnokiidev is the program which does this and hence it must be suid
   root so it can write to the directory. mgnokiidev is executable only
   for gnokii group members (and root) so it presents a minimal security
   risk.
   
   Be sure that you don't use a version of gnokii older than 0.3.5
   if you want to install mkgnokiidev suid root and give the access for
   execution for untrusted users. Earlier versions had security
   problems and allowed people to write to an arbitrary file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Should any other gnokii binary be installed suid root?

A. No. There is no need. gnokii isn't intended for setuid/setgid operation.
   If you set the setuid/setgid bit, you're taking a huge security
   risk. All you need is read/write permission for the device you are using
   for connection (port option in the config file). You can safely do it
   using groups management.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I'd like to send/receive sms, to handle voice calls, etc from my own
   application. What should I do?

A. If the license of your application is GPL the easiest solution is to
   use libgnokii. In this case you needn't to handle low level stuff,
   libgnokii will do it for you. If you want to use a scripting language,
   you can choose between Perl, PHP and Ruby.

   First version of Perl bindings was prepared by Konstantin Agouros and is
   available at:

     http://www.agouros.de/gnokii

   Please note that this version does not work with current version. The
   up-do-date version was prepared by H. Merijn Brand and is available at:

     http://repo.or.cz/w/GSM-Gnokii.git

   PHP bindings were prepared by Daniele Forsi and are available at:

     git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/gnokii/gnokii-extras.git

   Ruby bindings were prepared by Thyagarajan Shanmugham and are available at:

Q. Can I get a copy of the protocol for the <insert phone model here>?

A. We don't have any formal documentation of the protocols in use.

   Since we get this request once a week on average we'll repeat the answer
   here... :)

   We don't have any formal documentation of the protocols in use.

   The best source we can offer is the knowledge assembled by Nagy Balazs
   and Marcin Wiacek. You can find result of their work in Docs/protocol/
   subdirectory in gnokii sources. Note that not all known protocol functions
   are implemented in gnokii.

   There's a good introduction to FBUS:
       http://www.embedtronics.com/nokia/fbus.html

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Which cable for the Nokia phones should I use?

A. Please refer to the vendor website. They always have the most accurate
   information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. My phone is not mentioned as supported by gnokii, but it seems that it is
   similar to the one of the mentioned in the supported phones list? What
   should I do to check this out?

A. It is quite simple. If you use AT compatible phone you can just use
   'model = AT' in the config file. If you have Nokia and you would like to
   enable FBUS mode (it has more facilities then AT mode), there are few
   things you should do.

   For modern Nokias you can have either series40 or series60 phone. You can
   check this information at http://www.forum.nokia.com/Devices/.
   If you have series60 you are unlucky. You need to stick to AT driver. If you
   have series40 you may just try to run gnokii. If it doesn't work you may try
   adding the following section to the config file:
   
   [flags]
   RM-443=6303, PM_DEFAULT_S40_30

   The flags are explained in the sample config file. You can choose the right
   flags by comparing the OS version with the models configured in
   common/misc.c already.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I'm using the Win32 gnokii distribution and got the error "Couldn't open
   FBUS device". What's wrong?

A. Make sure that you put in the config file "port = com1:", not
   "port = :com1".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How do I enable debug output?

A. Place the new section in your config file (or update existing section in
   a similar way):

   [logging]
   debug = on

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Please help me configure my Nokia eXX/nYY to work with gnokii.

A. Nokia e and n series are Symbian Series60 3rd Edition based. Our gnapplet
   driver is not compatible with this OS (yet). You can get limited
   functionality (due to Symbian limitation) by using AT driver.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Why bluetooth connection under Windows does not work?

A. gnokii supports only MS bluetooth stack on Windows. Make sure you use it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Where gnokii config file is located?

A. As of gnokii 0.6.30 the primary locations where the config files are
   searched is:
     Windows: %APPDATA%\gnokii\gnokii.ini
     MacOS X: $HOME/Library/Preferences/gnokii/config
     Everything else: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnokii/config or
       $HOME/.config/gnokii/config
